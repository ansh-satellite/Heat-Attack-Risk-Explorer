# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Attack Risk Explorer - Predictive Modeling Approach

Welcome to the Heart Attack Risk Explorer, a comprehensive project leveraging data science and machine learning to analyze, visualize, and predict heart attack risks. This project provides an interactive dashboard and predictive model to help identify key patterns and correlations in cardiovascular health.

#üåü Key Features:

  #1. Interactive Dashboard:
  
    A) Distribution Analysis: Visualize critical features like:
       Age
       Body Mass Index (BMI)
       Cholesterol Levels
       Sleep Hours
       
     B) Heart Attack Risk by Smoking and Gender: Compare smoking patterns across genders.
     
     C) Blood Pressure Analysis: Analyze diastolic and systolic blood pressure distributions.
     
     D) Heart Attack Risk by Diabetes: Explore correlations between diabetes and heart attack risks using Chi-Square Statistical Tests with p-values.
     
 #2. Predictive Modeling:
 
     1. Developed a Random Forest Classifier for predicting heart attack risks.
     2. Achieved 64-65% accuracy using:
     3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
     4. Feature selection and scaling with StandardScaler.
     5. Evaluated using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     
 #3. Visualization Tools:
 
     Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create:
     1. Heatmaps
     2. Boxplots
     3. Histograms
     4. Bar graphs
    Incorporated Streamlit to build a dynamic and interactive frontend interface.

#üìä Data Insights:

 1. Correlations between diabetes, cholesterol levels, and heart attack risks.
 2. The impact of smoking and gender on cardiovascular health.
 3. Blood pressure patterns linked to heart attack risks.
 4. Visual storytelling for clear and actionable insights.
